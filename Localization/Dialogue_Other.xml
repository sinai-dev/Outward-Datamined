  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Basic_Rune_Book_a_01</Key>
    <Value>Can you teach me the basics of rune combination?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Basic_Rune_Book_01</Key>
    <Value>Runes are a highly flexible form of magic, and experimentation will be necessary. For beginners, a Lexicon is required to be held in the caster’s off-hand, as each rune has a multitude of meanings depending on their context.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Basic_Rune_Book_02</Key>
    <Value>Runes typically linger upon the caster after they're invoked. In order to create a tangible effect, one must cast a combination of runes in a set order. If a combination isn't valid, nothing will happen.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Basic_Rune_Book_03</Key>
    <Value>A simple spell is the Runic Blade, which forms a sword of pure mana that is naturally imbued with the Ethereal power. First, you must cast the Shim Rune, followed by the Egoth rune. Dropping the weapon will cause it to return to nothingness.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Basic_Rune_Book_04</Key>
    <Value>For those who are part of a prominent family that has earned my trust, like the Aberdeens and the Sutherlands, I can offer to teach you how to Internalize the Lexicon so that you no longer need one to cast rune spells.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Advanced_Rune_Book_a_01</Key>
    <Value>Can you teach me how to do advanced rune combinations?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Advanced_Rune_Book_01</Key>
    <Value>Very well, now that you understand the fundamentals of Advanced Runes, I can teach you how to put them into practice. Some rune combinations are effective only after another rune combination has been activated.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Advanced_Rune_Book_02</Key>
    <Value>For example, once you have cast a Runic Trap spell and it lies ready on the floor, perform “Shim”, then “Shim” again to create a Runic Blast that will detonate around you. Nearby foes will be harmed, but you won't!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Advanced_Rune_Book_03</Key>
    <Value>It’s a useful spell if your enemy evades your trap and is bearing down on you. Very few foes expect such a trick from a mage. Many more combinations like this exist with other Runic spells, and only through thoughtful experimentation can one reveal them.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Advanced_Rune_Book_04</Key>
    <Value>I would if I could, but to actually perform an advanced rune spell, you will need to learn the fundamental theory of advanced runes. Once I have taught them to you, ask me again and I can teach you one of those combinations.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Advanced_Rune_Book_a_05</Key>
    <Value>I’m having trouble understanding how to make combinations. Is there a shortcut you can teach me?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Advanced_Rune_Book_06</Key>
    <Value>Ahh...It goes against my every teaching, but I suppose I can teach you one dirty little trick, on one of two conditions. I crave Diadème de Gibier. It’s been years since I’ve had a bite of that exquisite desert dish...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Advanced_Rune_Book_07</Key>
    <Value>Bring me some Diadème de Gibier and I’ll teach you that little trick. Or, I suppose if the Collective owes you a Tribal Favor, I can make an exception to my rules and teach you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Advanced_Rune_Book_08</Key>
    <Value>Listen well, then. Mages came to the conclusion that each of the four runes are spells that are only useful when building runic combinations. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Advanced_Rune_Book_09</Key>
    <Value>While crude and incorrect in some edge cases, it is a valid approach. These broad categories by rune are: Dez meaning “Defense”, Shim meaning “Offense”, Egoth standing for “Self” and Fal meaning “Hidden”.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Advanced_Rune_Book_10</Key>
    <Value>Never forget that the order in which you cast these runes is important. You may find the proper combination of runes, but fail to cast a spell because you cast the runes in the wrong order.</Value>

    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_01</Key>
    <Value>I can’t believe that Old Levant is demanding we cede control of Abrassar to them! If it weren’t for Calixa and Simeon, this place would still be the hunting grounds of the Devourer! They should be thanking us on bended knee!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_01-b</Key>
    <Value>And now it looks like the Blue Chamber will blame us for the attack on Berg! Why don’t they bother to enforce the law in their own lands?! &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;They’ve had that gang of bandits running loose in the burnt forest of Enmerkar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; for months!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_02</Key>
    <Value>It’s surprising how people in the slums are sometime more aware of what happens in the city than us. I wonder how &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;many of them have their hands in criminal enterprises&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, to be so well informed.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_02-other</Key>
    <Value>I hear that bandit activity is on the rise in Abrassar. While I’m not one to cheer on criminals, it feels like justice. Levant’s armies loot and pillage every village they besiege! They’re no better than bandits, if you ask me!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_02-b</Key>
    <Value>You’re looking for “The Slide”? &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;There’s two entrances&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, one near those abandoned ships, and another one somewhere further south. I hear the tunnel gets a little narrow...you may need to crawl to get through.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_03</Key>
    <Value>Sorry, but if you want to order a meal, you can only get half a portion. We’re facing a famine with no idea when things will get better. I worry for the slums. They’ve been the hardest hit.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_03-b</Key>
    <Value>I just saw a Soroborean caravan come in with these giant tanks of water, with entire Marshmelon plants inside! I don’t know how they pulled that off, and I don’t care. The famine is over! Full course meals for everyone!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_03-other</Key>
    <Value>I hear that Levant has been hit by famine! Hopefully this leads to an end to the war... I hear their armies are pillaging every village they come across just to feed themselves!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_04</Key>

    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_06</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Levant_Info_07</Key>
    <Value>You’re looking for Yzan? “High and dry, where the boats used to be tied” huh? Well, there was an old set of docks up on a cliff where those ships are stranded. Give that a try... it’s in the north of Abrassar.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_01</Key>
    <Value>How is your attempt to pay off your Blood Price going? You’d better find that silver if you don’t want to lose your home! Oh! That reminds me, Helen Turnbull was around here, she said she was looking to hire someone for a job!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_01-b</Key>
    <Value>It’s also possible that some survivors of the wreck washed up on a beach further out in the Chersonese. If you could save one of them, I’m sure they’d return the favor.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_02</Key>
    <Value>Life’s going to be really quiet here without Yzan, Oliele and Rissa. They all asked you to come with them, right? Maybe you should take one of them up on their offer. What do you have to lose?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_03</Key>
    <Value>Oh! You look like the one that Rissa Aberdeen said she was planning to adopt into her family! Everyone in Berg is talking about it! New blood in such a prestigious bloodline could really change things in the Blue Chamber Collective!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_04</Key>
    <Value>What brings you to Monsoon, traveller? Are you thinking of joining the Holy Mission of Elatt? They could always use more dedicated people. I’ve been hearing more and more customers doubt in Elatt’s goals... It’s keeping me up at night.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_05</Key>
    <Value>You’re planning to become a Citizen of Levant, aren’t you, traveller? You’ve come at a difficult time. The slums are packed to bursting with new people, and we’re dealing with increasing bandit raids. I fear one more crisis will topple this entire house of cards!</Value>

    <Value>I want to join the Heroic Kingdom of Levant, how to I get there?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_06</Key>
    <Value>First, you need to head to Enmerkar forest. Head east past the Conflux Mountain, and keep watch for the Chersonese’s Vigil crystal. Head south of it and you’ll find the road to the forest.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_07</Key>
    <Value>In Enmerkar, stay on the north side of the lake and head east as you look for the stone walls of Berg, built into the northern mountain walls. But be wary! Manticores often hunt in that forest. They’re the region’s apex predator for good reason.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_08</Key>
    <Value>In Enmerkar, head East and past the stone city of Berg. Once you leave the stone walls and the lake behind, head north past a small stone archway. You’ll find the road to the Hallowed Marsh not much farther from there.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_09</Key>
    <Value>In Enmerkar, head south-east and past the lake. On the far eastern side of the forest, near the vigil, you’ll find the road to Abrassar Desert, the home of Levant.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_10</Key>
    <Value>First, you need to reach the Hallowed Marsh. Head east, past the Conflux Mountain. When you see the Chersonese’s Vigil crystal, make sure you pass north of it. The road to the Marsh is along that way.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_11</Key>
    <Value>When you reach the Hallowed Marsh, follow the Pilgrim Road. It’s what we call that trail of luminous sun-pillars that leads to Monsoon. If you lose the trail somehow, head north, following the giant ray of light above Monsoon, and you’ll get there eventually.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_12</Key>
    <Value>When you reach Abrassar desert, head east and look for the glowing city on top of a great hill, and you’ll have reached Levant. You may want to stop at the Oasis at the entrance of the desert to re-stock on water while you’re at it.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_13</Key>
    <Value>Unfortunately, there is no Pilgrim Road you can follow in the Hallowed Marsh from Enmerkar. You’ll have to manage on your own, following the Light Ray above Monsoon in the north until you reach the city.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_14</Key>
    <Value>Worse still, the Light Mender Lich has gotten very territorial. Getting past his Spire in the south may be very dangerous, unless you bypass it via the old flooded Ziggurat Tunnel. If this sounds too nasty for you, try getting there from the Chersonese.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_15</Key>
    <Value>In Enmerkar, go straight north. If you see the lake, you’re going the wrong way. Just go as north as you can, until you pass under a little stone arch, and then keep going until you reach the Hallowed Marsh.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_16</Key>
    <Value>To leave Abrassar desert, head as west as you can go. There’s an oasis not far from the road out of here where you can resupply your water, and maybe some berries, if you’re lucky.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_17</Key>
    <Value>Getting to Enmerkar Forest is very tricky from here. You’ll need to head east past the Vigil crystal, and then go south as far as you can go. You can try to use the Light Mender’s spire as a landmark, although it’s not perfectly reliable.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_18</Key>
    <Value>If you get to Enmerkar from the Marsh, go south, and then west as soon as you can. Take the first bridge you see, and you should find one of Berg’s gates right in front of you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_19</Key>
    <Value>If you get to Enmerkar from the Marsh, walk south then east. The city will be just north of the river.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Neutral_Info_20</Key>
    <Value>Once you reach Enmerkar, head north and then west, and take a bridge across the lake. Look for a city with stone walls built into the mountainside. That’s Berg, home of the Blue Chamber Collective.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Purifier_Info_01</Key>
    <Value>You have evidence of a plot against the Holy Mission? I can think of several people who will want to hear about this! Rissa Aberdeen at the town square, Sagard Battleborn here at the inn, Cyril Turnbull at the Blue Chamber, and Mathias at his home near the inn.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>InnKeeper_Purifier_Info_02</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_KL_prequest_09</Key>
    <Value>You should try &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cyrene, by the entrance to the Palace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, she'll approve you if you can help our army. Or you can always make a deal with Sir Montgomery, the &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baron&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; of the slums. He's usually &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;outside his manor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;.</Value>

    <Value>Go to the &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conflux Mountain in the Chersonese&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. That large purple one. Up along the side of the mountain is a passage with our flag beside it. Use that to get inside and down to the Ley Line.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_KL_prequest_08</Key>
    <Value>You must be that one that Yzan was talking about from Cierzo. Square things with him first, and then maybe we can talk. He’s down by the fountain near the Inn.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_KL_prequest_09</Key>

    <Key>Cyrene_KL_prequest_10</Key>

    <Value>A new refugee, hmm? I'm Baron Montgomery. So long as you pay your dues, you're welcome to stay, as far as I'm concerned.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Baron_KL_prequest_02</Key>
    <Value>You look like the adventurous type. If you &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;bring me 200 silver coins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, I'll vouch for you and give you a place to stay. That's a better deal than a lot of people can hope for these days.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Baron_KL_prequest_03</Key>
    <Value>Excellent. Here's a letter of introduction for our Queen. She'll arrange for your citizenship. Oh, and here. Your place to stay. Find a stretch of ground that's not occupied and roll that out.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Baron_KL_prequest_04</Key>
    <Value>Hey now, what's with that look? I kept up my end of the deal, didn't I? You should show some gratitude!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Baron_KL_prequest_05</Key>
    <Value>Shoo, now. You have your approval to become a citizen of Levant. Once you’ve introduced yourself to the Queen, it’s a done deal.</Value>

    <Key>Calixia_KL_prequest_02</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>ShopPressured_NEUT_04</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Kirouac_NEUT_Initial_02</Key>
    <Value>I’m the one who convinced King Simeon and Queen Calixa to declare Levant to be a nation outside the Blue Chamber’s laws. Not one of us regrets it. Here, anyone can be free to pursue their dreams without Tribal Laws restricting them!</Value>
  </Dialogue>

    <Key>Kirouac_NEUT_Initial_05</Key>
    <Value>Here, I have to reward you for this. I’ve got 100 silver on me, and by my Queen you deserve every last one of them! Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to get back to Berg and try to sort this mess out!</Value>

    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_01</Key>
    <Value>I'm sorry that was the first thing you woke up to, [PlayerName]. Please, forgive them. Many of them have lost family and are not thinking straight.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_a_01</Key>
    <Value>I can't believe they want to seize my home! Can't you do something?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_02</Key>
    <Value>If I could do more, I would. The most I can do for you is declare a mourning period and buy you a little time. If you do not pay off those 4 months of missed payments on your own, the tribe would have my head. For 5 days, no one in the tribe can ask for what you owe.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_03</Key>
    <Value>That gives you &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;5 days to pay back all 150 silver coins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. Either gather the money or earn a &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tribal Favor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, and they won’t be able to touch you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_04</Key>
    <Value>Once you can make the payment, come see me up at the town hall on top of the hill. Please, find a way to make it work, [PlayerName]. The last thing I want to do is take your lighthouse away.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_a_05</Key>
    <Value>How can I earn a Tribal Favor so quickly?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_06</Key>
    <Value>One sailor is still missing. The current may have pushed him to the shore of the southern beach. If you bring him alive…well, the Tribe would owe you a great favor.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_07</Key>
    <Value>You're planning to use the &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;tunnel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; under the lighthouse storage area to save time, aren't you? Make sure you're prepared for the outside world first if you do.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_08</Key>
    <Value>Someone saw Troglodytes in there last night. Also, once you leave those tunnels, you can’t use them to return to Cierzo.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_b_05</Key>
    <Value>I can't possibly accomplish that! I need more time!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_09</Key>
    <Value>A dozen people lost their lives in that shipwreck, leaving grieving kin behind. Their need outweighs yours. Trust me, [PlayerName], I wouldn’t be doing this to you otherwise. Their families need the assistance immediately.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_10</Key>
    <Value>You must find a way to pay what is owed to the tribe. The last thing I want is confiscate your home.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_c_05</Key>
    <Value>This Blood Price is unfair! You can't hold me responsible for things that are out of my control!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_11</Key>
    <Value>Have you forgotten why your family bears this Blood Price? When your grandmother was Chamberlady, she turned away the followers of Elatt in our time of greatest need, forcing the tribe to pray only to the Five Winds for protection.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_12</Key>
    <Value>Because of her pride, dozens were slain by the beasts of the Scourge. Your bloodline owes it to them to pay back that debt!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_a_12</Key>
    <Value>I understand. Bitterness still runs very deep in the tribe.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_13</Key>
    <Value>If you understand, then get to work making that payment, [PlayerName].</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_b_12</Key>
    <Value>How could I possibly forget? Not a day goes by without someone reminding me!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_14</Key>
    <Value>You live and breathe thanks to the deeds of your ancestors. You cannot embrace such a gift if you cannot also bear the costs of their actions. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_c_12</Key>
    <Value>I can't bear this stupid Blood Price any longer. What if I just leave and never come back?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_15</Key>
    <Value>If you think you can survive alone, out there in the wild, you have that right. But remember, your tribe is your family. We achieve more together than we do on our own.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_d_05</Key>
    <Value>Then I will have to head outside the walls.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_16</Key>
    <Value>That does seem like your most effective option, dangerous as it is. I doubt you'd be able to gather that much in such a short time just by staying in Cierzo.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_17</Key>
    <Value>Never forget, no one is an orphan in Cierzo. Do not hesitate to ask the rest of the tribe for survival advice. Though you owe us a Blood Price, we will still help you however we can.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_21</Key>
    <Value>If you can do a great deed for someone in Cierzo, we will owe you a &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tribal Favor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, which I will accept as a substitute for your payment.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_18</Key>
    <Value>Once you're ready to leave Cierzo, speak with Burac, the Gate Warden. He will judge whether or not you are prepared to face the outside world.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_19</Key>
    <Value>Remember, [PlayerName], you only have &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;5 days&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; to pay me the 150 silver, or show me proof you have earned a &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tribal Favor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; . May your ancestors watch over you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_b_22</Key>
    <Value>Who would be able to help me?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_20</Key>
    <Value>Eto is the Kazite Trainer. He can teach you about combat. Burac, the gate warden, can teach you about surviving out in the wild. I’m sure the shopkeepers can teach you about their expertise as well.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_22</Key>
    <Value>[PlayerName], how go your efforts?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_a_22</Key>

    <Value>What are your duties as Chamberlady? I never have paid much mind to politics.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_28</Key>
    <Value>I represent us within the Blue Chamber Collective, whenever the tribes need to make a decision that affects us all. Each of us bears one vote on the matters at hand.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_29</Key>
    <Value>Should a Chamberlord call a meeting, we gather in the city of Berg, the birthplace of our Collective, and hold a discussion, then a vote.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_30</Key>
    <Value>As such, I wield much power within the town of Cierzo, but only so long as my decisions are accepted. After all, your grandmother was Chamberlady once, before she was exiled for her actions. No one in the Collective is above the law.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_b_27</Key>
    <Value>You’re always trying to look after me. Why?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_31</Key>
    <Value>As children, your Father and I were close. I saw a future for us... but he could not stand by as the woman who would be your mother bore the weight of your grandmother's sins alone. There’s only so much a single huntress can manage.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_32</Key>
    <Value>They turned into a natural team, working to redeem your bloodline. I must admit, she was better suited for him... despite it all, we remained close friends.</Value>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_33</Key>

  </Dialogue>

    <Value>Well, I tried.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_47</Key>
    <Value>That you did, [PlayerName]. Even though the payment was late, you've proven you can survive in Aurai.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_a_46</Key>
    <Value>Lesson learned, then. I need to be more efficient.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_48</Key>
    <Value>Indeed. The world will not wait for you. Either move at Aurai's pace, or you will be left behind.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rissa_NE_Call_To_A_49</Key>

    <Value>Such is the way of the world...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_07</Key>
    <Value>Aye. And we can either bow to it, or rise against it. I know which one I'd rather do.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_07</Key>
    <Value>So we lost everything? All the coins? The spices? The armor and weapons?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_08</Key>
    <Value>Unfortunately, yes. What little we could salvage from the wreck has gone to the families of my drowned men. My finances are reeling from this loss. I have barely enough left to start over.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_09</Key>
    <Value>Still, we have no right to complain. All we lost was some coin and four months of time on this failed journey. My sailors lost their lives.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_09</Key>
    <Value>Of course. Their families need all the help they can get right now.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_10</Key>
    <Value>Kind as ever, [PlayerName]. Even struggling with your own problems, you still open your heart to those in need. Your parents would be proud.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_b_09</Key>
    <Value>Yzan, I have 5 days to gather 150 silver. Or I lose my home.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_11</Key>
    <Value>How much?! Damn, that’s right, you haven't been able to make payments on your Blood Price while we were gone. You always get the short end of the stick, don't you?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_12</Key>
    <Value>This Blood Price on your head is disgusting. It's unfair to hold anyone responsible for the crimes of their ancestors. You weren't even born when that tragedy happened!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_b_12</Key>
    <Value>I welcome the challenge. Besides, it's an excuse to get out there and find adventure.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_16</Key>
    <Value>More like find an early grave and lose a leg. “What doesn't kill you makes you stronger”? My prosthetic arm and leg are a testament to how stupid that sentiment is.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_17</Key>
    <Value>Suffering doesn’t help anyone. Any system that forces pain upon anyone innocent has no right to exist. I often wonder if we're alive because of our tribal laws, or in spite of them.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_c_12</Key>
    <Value>I know. But I don't have a choice.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_18</Key>
    <Value>Of course you do. Your life is your own. You choose what to do and where to go. Just because a choice is hard doesn't mean you can't take it.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_19</Key>
    <Value>I'm sorry I don't have better news, [PlayerName]. Well, I guess it's up to us to pick up the pieces. Best of luck with squaring things with Rissa in the short term.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_19</Key>
    <Value>I guess I truly am on my own, then...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_22</Key>
    <Value>Actually... I do have a &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;small stash of goods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; I hid, in case of disaster. I hid it near the &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;old shipwreck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; to the South. When you open it, remember that the &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moon Commands the Stars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. You'll know what I mean.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_23</Key>
    <Value>Remember, take care of yourself and don’t be a tool for others, or you’ll end with missing limbs like me. Make your own path.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_b_19</Key>

    <Key>Yzan_NE_Call_To_Advent_26-Fixed</Key>
    <Value>Fine! This is all I have, unless you're interested in a little fishing boat that you don't know how to steer. Take my 25 silver and buy yourself some decency. Get lost, [PlayerName].</Value>
  </Dialogue>

    <Value>Anything I should avoid outside of Cierzo?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rufus_NE_Call_To_Advent_02</Key>
    <Value>Well, for one thing, be wary on the beaches outside. An encounter with a pistol shrimp may prove deadly. There's a reason they're so colorful, it’s to warn other predators away!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rufus_NE_Call_To_Advent_03</Key>
    <Value>Not only are they nasty up close, they boast a deadly ranged attack as well. It’s charged with lightning, so use potions and armor that resist this type of attack if you fight one.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rufus_NE_Call_To_Advent_04</Key>

    <Value>You're a priest of Elatt, right? What can you tell me about him?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rufus_NE_Call_To_Advent_06</Key>
    <Value>As a human, he was far from perfect. He was supposedly brash and full of himself in his younger years. But he strove to improve himself day by day, and founded the Tribe Without Name, governed by the 3 Pillars the Holy Mission still follows.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rufus_NE_Call_To_Advent_07</Key>
    <Value>Then came the Scourge. Elatt, being a master of Magic, sacrificed his very humanity and became Living Thought, guiding us to the uneasy stalemate we’ve known for most of this century.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rufus_NE_Call_To_Advent_08</Key>
    <Value>The Five Winds we once prayed to were capricious. Elatt however... I’ve had the honor of speaking with him. He is very real. Having a god that was once mortal is comforting. He remembers what it was like to wear flesh like we do.</Value>

    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_04</Key>
    <Value>As a matter of fact, I could use a brash explorer for something. Tell me, what will you risk for some silver?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_04</Key>
    <Value>If the pay’s good, I'm willing to put my life in danger.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_b_04</Key>
    <Value>I’m not risking my life for coins, if that's what you're asking.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_05</Key>
    <Value>Fair enough. It is a good thing to understand your boundaries. If you find rare items, my coin purse is always open!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_06</Key>
    <Value>I’m looking for a particularly &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;rare mushroom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; in the shape of a shield. I hear it grows in &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blister Burrow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, north-east of Cierzo.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_07</Key>
    <Value>You’ll know it if you find it. The primary characteristics are its &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;immense size and red color&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. Bring me that mushroom and I’ll pay 70 silver for it.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_07-b</Key>
    <Value>That payment, plus whatever you loot and sell along the way, should be enough to cover your Blood Price. Just be careful in there, that cave is a Troglodyte breeding ground.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_07</Key>
    <Value>Troglodytes and deep dark caves? That sounds like a terrible idea. Pass!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_08</Key>
    <Value>And now you see why I don't want to go either. We are both smarter than we look!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_b_07</Key>
    <Value>What kind of properties does this mushroom have?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_09</Key>
    <Value>That's a trade secret, [PlayerName]. Maybe I'll tell you later. Are you interested, or not?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_c_07</Key>
    <Value>Sounds like an adventure. I'll do it!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_10</Key>
    <Value>Perfect! Make sure you have a good weapon, a lantern, and plenty of supplies. It’s a dangerous cave, and you will be putting your life on the line. Don't forget that Trogs have poor eyesight, but fantastic hearing.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_11</Key>
    <Value>To get to &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blister Burrow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, head out of Cierzo’s main gate, then follow &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;the road to the left&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. When you get to another &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;fork in the road at a wooden gate, turn left again&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_12</Key>
    <Value>You'll know you're going the right way if you see crude statues made by the troglodytes. The entrance should be just ahead of you, along the hillside.</Value>

    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_15</Key>
    <Value>I found this strange garnet in the ribcage of an Ash Giant.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_16</Key>
    <Value>Oho, an interesting piece. I’ll give you 30 silver for that.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_16</Key>
    <Value>Really, only 30? I could get a better price with the Ash Giants for returning this stone, I’m sure.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_17</Key>
    <Value>You drive a hard bargain, my friend. I’ll give you 50 silver, and not a single one more!</Value>
  </Dialogue>

    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_b_15</Key>
    <Value>No deal.</Value>

    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_23</Key>
    <Value>I’m all ears, what can you tell me?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_23</Key>
    <Value>I found this strange bullet that someone killed Zephyrien with. Do you know what this is?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_b_23</Key>
    <Value>I found this very beautiful Halberd. Interested?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_25</Key>
    <Value>Let me see that bullet! Oh my. I... can’t really tell much about it without tools, but... whoever designed this was a tremendously cruel person, and very prepared.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_26</Key>
    <Value>The casing itself is made from carefully forged Tsar Stone. I don’t think it’s possible to get that material back into usable form, though, not with that black poison goop all over it... Tell you what, I’ll buy this off you for 60 silver.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_26</Key>
    <Value>Mofat told me that the poison is distilled blood from an Immaculate. Only the Sorobor Academy would be able to refine something this dangerous.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_27</Key>
    <Value>Did he? He must have been mistaken. Sorobor Academy doesn’t do business with those monsters, and we certainly had no motive to see Zephyrien assassinated. Still... If it is Immaculate’s blood... How does 100 silver for the bullet sound?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_27</Key>
    <Value>I’m with the Holy Mission. I can’t let this get swept under the rug. This needs to be investigated!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_28</Key>
    <Value>Trust me, [PlayerName], I don’t think it’s possible for anyone to find the truth of the matter from outside of our organization. We’re too good at keeping secrets. Give it to me and I’ll take care of it. How does 120 silver interest you?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_28</Key>
    <Value>I don’t want your hush money! I’m keeping this bullet!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_29</Key>
    <Value>Let me see that halberd... Excellent craftsmanship! I know warriors that’d be interested in this. I’ll give you more silver for it than any merchant in Aurai!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_29</Key>
    <Value>Considering Sorobor’s recent scandal with those missing missionaries, I’m not sure handing this over is a good idea.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Helen_Turnbull_NE_Call_To_Advent_30</Key>
    <Value>Ah, yes, heard about that incident. Justice has been served and the people responsible have been dealt with, so I can assure you, giving this to me is quite safe. Of course, I could increase my price to 100 silver... What do you say?</Value>

    <Value>I'm glad you survived the wreck, [PlayerName]. And I'm sorry about your losses. I know how much you were counting on this expedition.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_01</Key>
    <Value>That glowing sword is new. When did you get it?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_02</Key>
    <Value>Rufus commissioned it for me as a going away present. I was going to leave this morning to go join the Holy Mission of Elatt before Mother could stop me.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_08</Key>
    <Value>But with the shipwreck... It wouldn't be right to leave. I have to stay with the tribe until the mourning period is over.</Value>
  </Dialogue>

    <Key>Player_Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_02</Key>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_03</Key>
    <Value>I know. Rissa already promised that the second she isn't drowning in important matters, she and I will be having a long talk.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_a_03</Key>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_04</Key>
    <Value>I know. I'll miss you and Yzan too. But this is the path I choose to walk. I'm done letting Rissa decide my life. I want to be part of the greater good, not rule over people.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_c_02</Key>
    <Value>You should just go now. You're abandoning your name and home anyway. Forget staying for the mourning period.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_05</Key>
    <Value>I would, but... Cierzo's still my home. I can't just leave when it's in such pain. As soon as the mourning period is over, though, I'm leaving. No matter what Mother says. I have delayed for too long already.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_d_02</Key>
    <Value>You have no idea... I don’t know how I’m going to gather the money Rissa is demanding from me.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_06</Key>
    <Value>I have faith in you, [PlayerName]. You'll pull through. If you can survive such a lethal shipwreck, I'm certain you can make your next Blood Price Payment.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Oliele_NE_Call_To_Advent_07</Key>
    <Value>Go, now. We both have work to do, for Cierzo's sake.</Value>
  </Dialogue>

    <Key>Player_Roland_NE_Call_To_Advent_b_02</Key>

    <Key>Roland_NE_Call_To_Advent_04</Key>

    <Key>Mob_NE_Call_To_Advent_04</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>

    <Key>Mob_NE_Call_To_Advent_05</Key>
    <Value>If you can't make the payments you missed, we will seize your home! That ought to cover four months of ignoring your duty to the tribe! Either pay up, or get out of our way!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>RissaMob_NE_Call_To_Advent_06</Key>
    <Value>Enough of this! Twelve people are dead! Stop this shameful behaviour at once! This is a time for the tribe to come together and mourn our lost loved ones, not to demand payment from a survivor!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>RissaMob_NE_Call_To_Advent_07</Key>
    <Value>To threaten someone like this while the lost lives are still fresh is an insult to their memory! [PlayerName] is a victim of that shipwreck too. Under the laws of the Blue Chamber Collective, I have declared a period of mourning. You understand what that means, don't you?</Value>
  </Dialogue>

    <Key>Mob_NE_Call_To_Advent_08</Key>

  </Dialogue>

    <Key>RissaMob_NE_Call_To_Advent_09</Key>
    <Value>I said, that is enough! If you want to resume ‘discussions’ with [PlayerName] after the mourning period, feel free. But until then, your concern should be for those whose lives were lost in the wreck. </Value>

  </Dialogue>

    <Value>What’s the best way to prevent taking hits from enemies?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>combat_tutorial_04</Key>
    <Value>When the enemy bears down on you, dodge to get out of harm's way. If your foe is quick, you may want to drop your backpack. Most backpacks slow down your roll.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>combat_tutorial_05</Key>
    <Value>Blocking will protect you from enemy physical attacks, but every hit you block will consume stamina. To block projectiles, you must use a shield. Against magical explosions, you will need to dodge.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>combat_tutorial_06</Key>
    <Value>If you need to get into a better position or to flee, sprint away. Take care not to run for too long, or you will be too exhausted to fight.</Value>

    <Value>How should I protect myself?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>combat_tutorial_07</Key>
    <Value>Some foes will do more than just strike at you with swords or claws. They might harm you with ice, fire, lightning or more. Wear equipment that resists the type of damage they inflict.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>combat_tutorial_08</Key>
    <Value>Every blow you take will destabilize you. If you take too many hits in a short time, you may be knocked off your feet. If you are being harried too hard, try to get some distance from your foe and regain your footing.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>combat_tutorial_09</Key>
    <Value>Likewise, if you manage to make your opponent stumble, press your advantage. Blunt weapons are an excellent choice to use this strategy. </Value>

    <Value>How do I sneak around unseen?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>combat_tutorial_11</Key>
    <Value>First, you’ll have better chance of avoiding attention if you’re in the dark. Then, put out any lit lanterns or torches and crouch down. Stay out of your enemy’s vision, and either sneak past them, or carefully approach them to attack.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>combat_tutorial_12</Key>
    <Value>You can use this stealthy approach to set up traps for your enemies, or to get the first strike with a melee weapon, or to backstab them if you’ve learned the right dagger skill.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>combat_tutorial_13</Key>
    <Value>Traps are powerful when you bait enemies into them. First, you need a trigger device like a tripwire, then you need to arm it with a compatible item like iron spikes.</Value>

    <Value>Many foes will infect you with temporary effects. These effects go away over time, although many can be cured with the right items.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>disease_tutorial_03</Key>
    <Value>For example, if you are bleeding and losing health, a bandage will stop the bleeding and heal you for a short while.</Value>

    <Value>What do I do if I catch a disease?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>disease_tutorial_05</Key>
    <Value>You can brew or buy various types of tea to begin the recovery process. To make your own in the wild, you’ll need the ingredients and a cooking pot, though. After drinking, you’ll need some time before the illness is actually cured.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>disease_tutorial_06</Key>
    <Value>If those options are unavailable, just rest for a long time. Have lots of water, sleep and food, and eventually you will beat back the disease. Depending on what you caught, it may take several days before you are well again. </Value>

    <Value>I’m not sure how to find food out there.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cooking_tutorial_02</Key>
    <Value>On top of hunting, you can forage for food. Pick Gaberries from bushes or use a Fishing Harpoon at a fishing spot. Cook any raw meat and boil any water that isn't "clean" before eating. You don't want to get sick. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Cooking_tutorial_a_02</Key>
    <Value>What’s a quick and easy way to cook?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cooking_tutorial_03</Key>
    <Value>Simple food can be cooked on a lit campfire. Cooked food rots slower and fills you up more. You can even boil River Water to turn it into Clean Water that is free of disease.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Cooking_tutorial_a_03</Key>
    <Value>I want to try my hand at more advanced dishes.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cooking_tutorial_04</Key>
    <Value>If you deploy a cooking pot over a campfire, or if you have a home with a proper kitchen, you’ll be able to cook recipes with more than one ingredient. They’ll be even more filling and often have special properties. A good meal before a fight will tilt the odds in your favor. </Value>

    <Value>What actually is Mana, and how do you control it?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Wizard_tutorial_02</Key>
    <Value>Mana is energy that flows through everything. Plants, animals, people, even rocks. Mages are those who’ve learned how to capture that energy and unleash it in the form of magic spells.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Wizard_tutorial_03</Key>
    <Value>Magic is something that requires patience to master. By combining spells in the right sequence, you will achieve better results than using a spell on its own.</Value>
  </Dialogue>

    <Value>Where can I learn magic?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Wizard_tutorial_04</Key>
    <Value>To unlock the secret of Mana, you must travel to a Ley Line, a place where Aurai's life flows strong. The nearest one is the one under the Conflux Mountain. You know it, right? The large purple mountain in the Chersonese. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Wizard_tutorial_05</Key>
    <Value>The Holy Mission and the Kingdom of Levant have their own paths into the Conflux Mountain as well, and each one will test you differently. They’ll all lead to the main chamber.</Value>

    <Value>What’s got you worried?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_needs_tutorial_a_01</Key>
    <Value>I’ve noticed that the longer I stay out, the less maximum health and stamina I have.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Needs_tutorial_02</Key>
    <Value>Pay attention to what your body tells you. As you push yourself, your maximum reserves of Health and Stamina will be diminished, and you'll only have a fraction of your maximum.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Needs_tutorial_03</Key>
    <Value>Sleeping in a tent or a bed will restore your reserves of Stamina and Health. Always be mindful of your limits and don't push them more than you need. There is no shame in taking time to set up camp when you are exhausted.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_needs_tutorial_a_02</Key>
    <Value>How important is it to eat, drink and sleep?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Needs_tutorial_04</Key>
    <Value>Your body has needs. Hunger, thirst and exhaustion are persistent foes, so eat and drink when you need to. With a little preparation, you will find it easy enough to take care of yourself. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Needs_tutorial_05</Key>
    <Value>Rest is the best remedy for a wounded body. If your reserves of Health and Stamina are diminished or you are gravely injured, it’s a good idea to rest in a bedroll or a tent.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Needs_tutorial_06</Key>

    <Value>How do I deal with dangerous temperatures?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Needs_tutorial_07</Key>
    <Value>Be mindful of the weather and climate you travel in. When the cold rolls in, you should dress warmly and use campfires or torches for warmth. If you stay cold for too long you may get sick, and eventually freeze to death.</Value>
  </Dialogue>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_smith_tutorial_a_00</Key>
    <Value>What can you tell me about handling equipment?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Smith_tutorial_01</Key>
    <Value>Quite a lot. Tell me what you want to know.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_smith_tutorial_a_01</Key>
    <Value>What’s more effective? One-handed weapons, or two-handed?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Smith_tutorial_02</Key>
    <Value>It depends on your situation. Weapons that need two hands are often stronger and have superior reach, but one handed weapons allow you to carry trinkets like shields or lanterns in your off-hand.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_smith_tutorial_a_02</Key>
    <Value>How do I use a bow?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Smith_tutorial_03</Key>
    <Value>The simplest way to ensure damage at range is a good bow and some arrows. Keep a good supply of arrows equipped, and craft more arrows if you run low.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Smith_tutorial_04</Key>
    <Value>To shoot arrows, hold, then release the bowstring. Locking on enemies is useful with bows. For precision shots, you can even zoom in.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_smith_tutorial_a_03</Key>
    <Value>Why are shields useful?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Smith_tutorial_05</Key>
    <Value>Use a shield to consume less of your stamina and stability when blocking enemy physical attacks. Shields block projectiles, but not explosions.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_smith_tutorial_a_04</Key>
    <Value>How do I maintain my equipment durability?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Smith_tutorial_06</Key>
    <Value>Your equipment will be worn down with time and use. You can still use a broken piece of equipment if you need to, but it will be far less effective than if it was well-maintained. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Smith_tutorial_07</Key>
    <Value>To repair your gear, dedicate time to it when you set up camp. It’ll only repair what’s equipped on you, so it’ll take several rest periods to repair other weapons or armor you keep for special situations.</Value>

    <Value>Can you teach me about survival crafting?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>crafting_tutorial_02</Key>
    <Value>Whenever you need to, you can craft a great variety of items to aid in your survival. For example, some wood and linen cloth can be made into a torch if you need light.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>crafting_tutorial_03</Key>
    <Value>Not only can you assemble things like tents, backpacks and weapons out of raw materials, you can also disassemble many items like clothes or weapons to get materials. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>crafting_tutorial_04</Key>
    <Value>Using what your environment provides you, either through experimentation or learning crafting recipes, is the difference between a lost wanderer and an expert explorer. </Value>

    <Value>How useful is it to have a backpack?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>crafting_tutorial_05</Key>
    <Value>The backpack is one of the most essential tools for any traveller. You’ll be able to carry more before you are over encumbered, and you can hang a lantern from most backpacks, freeing both your hands when exploring dark caves. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>crafting_tutorial_06</Key>
    <Value>If you get into a fight, however, it's usually best to drop the bag. You see, backpacks slow down your dodge.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>crafting_tutorial_07</Key>
    <Value>Oh, and a word of caution. Should your backpack be hit, it’ll damage the items inside. Food, weapons and armor pieces in your pack can be damaged this way.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_craft_tutorial_a_03</Key>
    <Value>What’s a good way to handle my inventory?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>crafting_tutorial_08</Key>
    <Value>Keep only what you can't live without in your pockets, and store your camp gear and loot in your backpack. This will keep you light on your feet and more effective in a fight.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>crafting_tutorial_09</Key>
    <Value>Learning how to effectively split your gear between backpack and pockets is essential. You don't want to find yourself without bandages at a bad time, and you don't want to be overburdened either. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>crafting_tutorial_10</Key>
    <Value>While wearing a backpack, what you pick up goes in the backpack. Consider setting items you use often, like bandages, to quickslots to have them ready during combat.</Value>

    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_01</Key>
    <Value>Welcome. I am a Watcher of the Ley Line. Do you have questions about the art of magic, visitor?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_02</Key>
    <Value>What actually is Mana, and how do you control it?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_03</Key>
    <Value>Mana is the energy that is the flows through all things. With proper preparation, you may use it to force the world to bend to your will by casting spells. Alone, most spells are weak, but when combined or used in the right ritual sequence, their power is made manifest.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_04</Key>
    <Value>You can rest to recharge mana, but be warned. Your maximum capacity for Mana can only be maintained with rigid focus. If you sleep, it will take time before you will be able to call upon your full reserves of Mana again. A sleeping mind loses its connection to the real world, after all.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_05</Key>
    <Value>Can you teach me magic?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_06</Key>
    <Value>To unlock the power of mana, you must give up some of your mortal vitality to a Ley Line, a place where Aurai's life flows strong, like this very chamber. If you wish to become a mage, touch the crystal at the center of the chamber.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_07</Key>
    <Value>The Holy Mission and the Kingdom of Levant have their own paths to this chamber, so if you wish to return here, you could take their particular path to get back here in a different manner.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_08</Key>
    <Value>I notice that most mages don’t wear heavy helmets, why not?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_09</Key>
    <Value>To cast spells frequently, I’d advise you to wear light headgear so it won’t interfere with your body's flow of Mana. Heavy helmets limit your capacity to cast spells.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_10</Key>
    <Value>If you wish to recharge your reserves of Mana, having a meal will help, especially a certain blue vegetable that... Honestly I’ve gotten a little sick of eating so often. You can also pull Mana from lingering souls, with the right technique.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageA_tutorial_11</Key>
    <Value>Now that mana flows through your veins, I can teach you a new spell to welcome you as a mage.</Value>

    <Value>So, you have come. I sensed that someone who had the potential for magic was on their way</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageB_tutorial_02</Key>
    <Value>If you wish to gain Magic, you must first give. You must sacrifice Health and Stamina to the Ley Line, and in return what you gave up will be given back to you as Mana.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageB_tutorial_03</Key>
    <Value>Be careful how much of your Health and Stamina you give up, because once you have traded it for Mana, you can never get it back.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageB_tutorial_04</Key>
    <Value>The first time you gain Mana, you will gain your first spell, the Spark. It may seem small and weak, but when combined with other spells or components, it can produce powerful effects. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageB_tutorial_05</Key>
    <Value>Welcome, mage. May your talent for magic only grow stronger.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageB_tutorial_06</Key>
    <Value>Never underestimate the humble Spark spell. It may seem small and weak, but when combined with other spells or components, it can produce powerful effects. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageB_tutorial_07</Key>
    <Value>If you feel that your current reserves of Mana are insufficient, you may still offer up your health and stamina to the Ley Line for more power, but never forget that the exchange is permanent.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageB_tutorial_08</Key>
    <Value>If you wish to learn the most complex of spells, seek out Rune Magic in Berg. Only by properly combining them will you unlock their power. They are spells that require experimentation, but are flexible once you understand them.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Conflux_MageE_tutorial_02</Key>
    <Value>To open yourself to Mana is to open yourself to the flow of our world. To use magic is to command the world to obey your desires. Master magic, and you master the flow that echoes through us all.</Value>

    <Key>Conflux_MageE_tutorial_03</Key>

    <Value>If you're pressed to find a weapon, make yourself a &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;quarterstaff&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; from some tree wood. You can also craft a &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;backpack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, although I'm sure you have one lying around at home.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_TutorialGate_09</Key>
    <Value>Stay far away from the north-east in particular. I've heard rumors of a Scourge Beast, a shell horror specifically, near the Ghost Pass. It’s probably just a rumor, but better safe than sorry, I say.</Value>

    <Value>Waiting on some scouts to come back from reconnaissance. Up to date information on what’s happening in the surrounding region is essential to keeping Cierzo safe.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_TutorialGate_14</Key>
    <Value>There's a bandit group I suspect is planning to attack us, and I want us to be prepared. I may be a skilled warrior, but against two dozen foes even I would be swept aside.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_TutorialGate_15</Key>
    <Value>My warriors and I are the last line of defense for Cierzo. We decide what enters and what is driven from our walls. We bear the heaviest responsibility in this tribe.</Value>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_TutorialGate_16</Key>
    <Value>Well, you’ve got the essentials at least. Here, I'll teach you a &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;skill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. Mastering these is the key to survival out in the wild. Want me to teach you one for the weapon you’re currently holding?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_TutorialGate_16-b</Key>
    <Value>There you go! Mastering skills like this one is the key to survival out in the wild. You should look for Trainers whenever you visit a new town. They usually group near training equipment. Others need to be sought out.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Burac_TutorialGate_b_16</Key>
    <Value>I think I want to learn one for a different weapon, give me a minute Burac.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_TutorialGate_17</Key>
    <Value>Alright, I’ll let you go outside the town’s walls. Use the gate whenever you want to head out. Stay safe out there.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_00</Key>
    <Value>Ah, [PlayerName], I am glad that you're back. We need all the help we can get. The &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fortress of Vendavel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; has become a threat we can't ignore!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_00-b</Key>
    <Value>I hope I can count on your help dealing with the fortress of Vendavel. It remains a deadly threat to Cierzo.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_01</Key>
    <Value>When it was just squatting bandits, it was bad enough. Now we know that &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;3 warlords&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; have begun to order them into an army. I think they mean to attack Cierzo. If they do... I don't know if we can hold them off.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Burac_Vendavel_a_01</Key>
    <Value>What do you recommend we do?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_02</Key>
    <Value>I honestly don't know. If we send any kind of force to go attack the fortress, we risk stirring the hornet's nest…If only if we could separate and deal with the Warlords one at a time...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_03</Key>
    <Value>It would be very dangerous to infiltrate the fortress. Use discretion and caution. Messing with Vendavel might get you imprisoned, enslaved, or worse.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Burac_Vendavel_a_03</Key>
    <Value>Do you know who is organizing them?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Burac_Vendavel_b_03</Key>
    <Value>I’ll take care of it.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_04</Key>
    <Value>One is a former warrior of mine, Crock. Exiled after he murdered two of my men in a drunken brawl. Another is a Kazite pirate captain even Eto is wary about... I think they know each other.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_05</Key>
    <Value>And lastly, there’s a mage who used to be part of one of Harmattan’s tribes. &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;All 3 of them need to be dealt with&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. If you have to, kill them. They’re that much of a threat.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_06</Key>
    <Value>My men tell me that Vendavel has gotten a lot quieter. I don’t want to think about the disaster that would have hit! On behalf of all of Cierzo, I thank you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_07</Key>
    <Value>Say, you were the one who sent Crock out here to challenge me, weren't you? Very smart move. A single drunkard like that was no threat to me. I’ve locked him in a cell below the town hall. Once Rissa comes back, we’ll decide what to do with him.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_08</Key>
    <Value>My men tell me that Vendavel has gotten a lot quieter. On behalf of all of Cierzo, I thank you. I do not want to think about the disaster what would have hit us if you hadn’t!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_09</Key>
    <Value>Remember that the Fortress of Vendavel is a threat to the very existence of Cierzo. Be careful, [PlayerName].</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_10</Key>
    <Value>And what did you want to talk about?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>

    <Value>I want to talk about Vendavel.</Value>

    <Value>What do you want to know?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Burac_Vendavel_12</Key>
    <Value>Here, I feel I can trust you with the key to Cierzo. It’ll open up anything you like in town, including the vault in the Chamberlady’s town hall.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_00</Key>
    <Value>Amba, friend [PlayerName]. The threat of the Vendavel has me very worried. I would go to take care of them, but... I think one of those warlords, the Kazite... I think I know who it is. He would recognize me and kill me before I even got inside.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Eto_Vendavel_a_00</Key>
    <Value>I want to do something about Vendavel too, where is it?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_01</Key>
    <Value>It's the old fortress on the beach to the south-west of the Chersonese. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_02</Key>
    <Value>Is there a safe way to get inside?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_03</Key>
    <Value>I think so... Bring me &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;3 iron scraps and some Blue Sand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; and I can modify one of my Kazite masks to fit you. If you cover your face with it, and say the right words, you may convince the gatekeepers that you are one of them.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Eto_Vendavel_b_00</Key>
    <Value>I found what you’ll need to modify the mask, Eto.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_04</Key>
    <Value>Ah! Perfect. Wait for a moment, it will not take long.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_05</Key>
    <Value>It should fit you now. Make sure you &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;wear this&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; before you try to talk to the guards. If he is a Kazite pirate too, it is important to greet him with the word “Nindiria”. It roughly means sea-brother. And try to speak like me, yes?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Eto_Vendavel_c_00</Key>
    <Value>About the warlord you said you know in Vendavel...</Value>

    <Value>Yes? You have news of him?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Eto_Vendavel_a_06</Key>
    <Value>It’s your uncle... He said he is only attacking Cierzo to get revenge. If you turn yourself in to him right away, he will leave Cierzo alone for good.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_08</Key>
    <Value>AIE! I knew it... That Nanzome... That Black Heart... He would kill so many just to punish me? Then, if my life will buy the lives of all of Cierzo, I will give it to him.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Eto_Vendavel_a_08</Key>
    <Value>Don’t go, I’ll kill the bastard myself. Just stay safe until then.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Eto_Vendavel_b_08</Key>
    <Value>I’m sorry, Eto...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_09</Key>
    <Value>Do not be. Actions always have consequences. I knew this may happen the moment I took up my sword against him. But I have no regrets. It was good to know you, [PlayerName]. Take care of yourself.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Eto_Vendavel_c_08</Key>

    <Value>You were wrong, no one there knows you. It's safe for you to sneak in.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_10</Key>
    <Value>You are... sure? I trust you, [PlayerName]. If you say it is safe, then I will go infiltrate the fortress. I will see you very soon, with the warlords here in chains!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_11</Key>
    <Value>If you think you can stop him... then I will stay here. Cejo murio tapame amba. Best of luck, my friend.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_12</Key>
    <Value>Amba, friend [PlayerName]! I heard you destroyed the warlords of Vendavel! Perhaps I should call you the champion of Cierzo, now!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Eto_Vendavel_13</Key>
    <Value>Yes, if you wear a mask like a Kazite, and say the right words, you should be able to pretend that you are one of them.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Hermit_Vendavel_00</Key>
    <Value>I know her, she was an apprentice of mine. Then, she twisted the gifts of the Five Winds to perform forbidden and horrible magic. Manipulating a person's Inside Wind, no matter the reason, is a violation of a person's most sacred boundary.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Hermit_Vendavel_01</Key>
    <Value>I told her she was never to come here again after what she did. And yet... although I cannot forgive her sacrilege, it's time to set aside this tragedy.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Hermit_Vendavel_02</Key>
    <Value>The man... or rather, what's left of the man you're looking for is hiding in the old &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;broken tombs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; within this valley. He, or rather, "it" lives in the &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;frozen cavern&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; at the mouth of it. Put an end to its misery, and break their connection.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>BaliraWitch_Vendavel_03</Key>
    <Value>Why should I do that? Cierzo bears some responsibility for what happened to me. Although... there is one thing you can do that could make me reconsider. I need you to kill someone for me. My former husband.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_BaliraWitch_Vendavel_a_03</Key>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>BaliraWitch_Vendavel_04</Key>
    <Value>My mother arranged our marriage when I was young, she said it would benefit both our own tribe and Cierzo. He was... cruel when no one looked, and seemed incapable of realizing the harm he caused. In an attempt to make him understand, I tried something drastic.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>BaliraWitch_Vendavel_05</Key>
    <Value>I used magic I learned from the Cabal of Winds to twist our Inside Winds, our spirits, together. It only made things worse. He could sense my fear of him, and it drove him mad. He set fire to our home and fled into the night.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>BaliraWitch_Vendavel_06</Key>
    <Value>Because our spirits are still twisted together, if he senses me coming to find him, he will flee from me. I need someone else to put him down and end this horrid bond between us.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_BaliraWitch_Vendavel_a_06</Key>
    <Value>Where do I start looking?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>BaliraWitch_Vendavel_07</Key>
    <Value>The bastard’s hiding in the Chersonese, in the valley beyond Ghost Pass. He’s made his den in the Corrupted Tombs. I can sense cold ice all around him.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>BaliraWitch_Vendavel_08</Key>
    <Value>Track him down and &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;kill him&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. He's nothing but a monster now, in every sense of the word. His nightmarish thoughts haunt me even now.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>BaliraWitch_Vendavel_09</Key>
    <Value>I can sense my late husband's Mana clinging to your very skin, and his monstrous thoughts no longer fill my dreams. Thank you. Tell me, what had happened to him?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_BaliraWitch_Vendavel_a_09</Key>
    <Value>He had become a Wendigo.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>BaliraWitch_Vendavel_10</Key>
    <Value>I thought as much. Thank you for ending this nightmare. Cierzo has repaid its debt to me. &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;I no longer have a quarrel with them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;.</Value>
  </Dialogue>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rospa_Vendavel_03</Key>
    <Value>Aho! You care for that bundle of huts, do you? Maybe I'll make you watch as I burn it to the ground. My Nanzome of a nephew betrayed us for those land-loving ghost-men. So long as Eto Akiyuki lives, my fury will know no quiet.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rospa_Vendavel_04</Key>
    <Value>You want me to call off the destruction of Cierzo? Then bring that Nanzome, that black heart traitor, to me. &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give me Eto’s life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, and I will give you the lives of the worthless ash-faces in that tiny village!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rospa_Vendavel_05</Key>
    <Value>If you agree, I will let you leave to bring him here. Send him here within 1 day, or I will make you pay!</Value>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rospa_Vendavel_09</Key>
    <Value>Ah, Amba, my nandipame friend. You brought me Eto's head. I made him pay. I made him scream. I am no Nanzome, I honor my word and my bonds. I have no love for Cierzo, but &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;I will spare it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; even so. My fury is satisfied... For now.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Rospa_Vendavel_10</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Mofat_Purifier_03</Key>
    <Value>He would have come via the Chersonese, so if he’s out in the swamp, he should be taking the Pilgrim Road, and following the glowing sigils. &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you find him&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, please let me know, eh?</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Mofat_Purifier_a_07</Key>
    <Value>It was beside a campsite, with three bedrolls</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Mofat_Purifier_08</Key>
    <Value>So, he must have come with two others. I can only hope that at least one of them made it to Monsoon safely. My guess is that his companions were Amalie and Alemmon, both were supposed to come home sometime this month.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Mofat_Purifier_09</Key>
    <Value>Amalie usually comes to talk to me when she returns from a trip abroad... I suspect the only survivor would be Alemmon. He usually holds open magic lessons over in the training district. If he survived, &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;he might be able to tell us what happened&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;.</Value>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Mofat_Purifier_10</Key>
    <Value>This is the third time in two months that some of our people have gone missing like this... I begin to worry if there's a conspiracy against the Holy Mission. Bandit attacks are frequent enough, but they usually demand ransom within a few days. This feels far more sinister.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Mofat_Purifier_11</Key>
    <Value>I am trying to gather more information on these attackers, but there is only so much I can do in my old age. 143 years, even with Elatt’s blessing, eventually takes its toll on you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Mofat_Purifier_12</Key>
    <Value>The occasional scrap against a Tuanosaur as I gather alchemy ingredients, that’s one thing. Combing the marsh for people waiting in ambush is quite another. I hate having to rely on anyone else for this task, but that’s the way it has to be.</Value>

    <Value>A group of people was attacked along the Pilgrim Road recently, were you one of them?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_01</Key>
    <Value>Yes, I take it you want to know what happened? I’ve already reported the incident to the Cardinal, but if you want to know, I can tell you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Alemmon_Purifier_a_01</Key>
    <Value>Yes, talk to me about it.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_02</Key>
    <Value>I was making camp with Jael and Amalie when we were ambushed by several bandits with levantine firearms. Their initial volley caught Jael in the lungs. They demanded we disarm and come with them or suffer the same fate.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_03</Key>
    <Value>They took us up a &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;mountain not too far from the campsite,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; and... Amalie made a regrettable move. She saw an opening and tried to disarm one of our captors. Things got bloody. We both tumbled into the poisonous swamp water under the mountain cliffs.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_04</Key>
    <Value>I managed to get us both to dry land, but by then the damage was already done. All I could do was close her eyes and make haste for Monsoon.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Alemmon_Purifier_a_04</Key>
    <Value>Mofat said he was concerned this might be a plot against Monsoon.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_05</Key>
    <Value>That would be surprising to me. Yes, this attack was considerably more aggressive than the usual bandit raid, but nothing suggests an actual plot against the Holy Mission.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_06</Key>
    <Value>However, I do agree that something felt off about this group of bandits. They seemed too well-armed to be the usual gang of thugs.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Alemmon_Purifier_b_04</Key>
    <Value>Why do you think you were attacked?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_07</Key>
    <Value>Who knows with these kinds of people. Usually we just get held for ransom, or they let us go once they realize they’ve taken a member of the Holy Mission prisoner. Something did feel off about these ones, though. Too organized.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Alemmon_Purifier_c_04</Key>
    <Value>You said they took you up the mountain near the campsite, right?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_08</Key>
    <Value>Yes, the one off to the&lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt; west of the campsite&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, through the root arches. There’s a large network of tunnels under it, burrowed by tree roots. I suspect the criminals set up camp in there.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Alemmon_Purifier_d_04</Key>
    <Value>I think I might go investigate this myself. Thank you for the information.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_09</Key>
    <Value>Elatt watch over you, then. I hope you get to the bottom of this.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_10</Key>
    <Value>One of my friends came back from a pilgrimage to the Chersonese, and saw a gang of Blue Chamber warriors. They’re camping in the old crumbling ruins along the Pilgrim Road.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_11</Key>
    <Value>While I hope they find safety and sanctuary in the Marsh, if they’re here to bring the war to Monsoon, I hope the Cardinal sends a Templar to re-educate them. Hopefully with a quarterstaff.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_12</Key>
    <Value>I’m glad you managed to rescue Oliele. She’s an inquisitive girl, and I’d hate to see her come to harm.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_13</Key>
    <Value>It’s a shame Oliele is still locked up in Lockwell’s home. I saw the incident and can wholeheartedly say it was self-defense. Lockwell’s just doing this to assert some kind of misguided dominance over the Holy Mission.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_14</Key>
    <Value>You’re Oliele’s friend from Cierzo, right? I know where Oliele is. I can’t go, Lockwell’s got one of his thugs stalking me. She’s somewhere in or near &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;the old ruins along the Pilgrim Road&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Alemmon_Purifier_15</Key>
    <Value>I’ve seen Lockwell’s house guard around that place often enough, and the night Oliele went missing, he was out of Monsoon. I’d bet a lot of silver she’s out there in those old ruins somewhere.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Corpse_Purifier_03</Key>
    <Value>(He’s carrying a letter in his breast pocket. The bloodstains have ruined most of it, but you think you can see &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mofat’s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; name signed at the bottom. He would want to know what happened here.)</Value>

    <Key>Clues_Purifier_05-b</Key>
    <Value>“We suspect he may have other motives in mind, and the longer we stay in this marsh, under the shadow of the enemy, the greater our chances of being discovered and killed. Take no risks, my kin. We Immaculates always stand alone in this world.”</Value>

    <Value>(The pieces are coming together. Someone from the &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sorobor Academy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; is arming these bandits, but for what end you’re not quite sure.

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_DamianLockwell_Purifier_a_00</Key>
    <Value>There was a gang of bandits that were attacking the Holy Mission.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>DamianLockwell_Purifier_01</Key>
    <Value>Oh, they were just interested in the Holy Mission? Then, frankly, what the Holy Mission does is its business. If their “god” can’t protect them from a few measly bandits, I don’t see how it’s my problem.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_DamianLockwell_Purifier_a_01</Key>
    <Value>They were funded by Sorobor and very well armed. They could be a threat to Monsoon in the future.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>DamianLockwell_Purifier_02</Key>
    <Value>Sorobor, you say? I don’t know why anyone from the Sorobor Academy would stoop to arming bandits, but even so, if they’re that well armed, they could pose a threat to my citizens.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_DamianLockwell_Purifier_b_01</Key>
    <Value>There are Immaculates working with Sorobor soldiers in the Marsh.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>DamianLockwell_Purifier_04</Key>
    <Value>Elatt damn it all. &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;I'll hire some more guards and mercenaries to defend Monsoon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; until the threat has passed. Those idiots at the temple had better appreciate what I’m doing for the city they’re squatting in!</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Jager_Purifier_a_02</Key>
    <Value>You were having mercenaries kidnap Holy Mission members so you could learn to control the instinct of Immaculates.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Jager_Purifier_03</Key>
    <Value>Even assuming you're right, which you're not, what would be wrong with that? Learning to make the Immaculates into useful pawns rather than barely sentient monsters would benefit everyone.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Jager_Purifier_a_03</Key>
    <Value>Let's see if the Chamberlords think of this the same way. I think they'll find the evidence more than convincing enough to arrest you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Jager_Purifier_04</Key>
    <Value>Dammit, I told those idiots to burn anything that could be used as evidence! Bah, you've got me by the stones, [PlayerName]. How much for your silence? Give me the evidence and I'll give you 100 silver and three pieces of Hackmanite.</Value>

    <Value>Smart move. We won't meet again, I assure you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Jager_Purifier_07</Key>
    <Value>Move along, bum. This is private property. I’m one of Sorobor’s top financiers, and unless you’re a Chamberlord or someone with priceless artifacts for sale, I have nothing to say for you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Jager_Purifier_a_00</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrill_Purifier_03</Key>
    <Value>Elatt's name... If this were to get out, the scandal would be catastrophic! Listen, I can make it worth your while if you hand them over to me. We will handle this with an internal investigation, and the guilty party will be... dealt with.</Value>

    <Value>How? Give him a desk job away from anyone else?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrill_Purifier_04</Key>
    <Value>Well, that depends on how flexible the culprit is, isn't it? The blood price that a scandal this monstrous would bring on his family would drive a considerable amount of people to murder him rather than risk the truth getting out.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrill_Purifier_04-b</Key>
    <Value>Unless he wants to end up with a knife in his back, he's going to do whatever we tell him to for the very foreseeable future. He will not get off easily for what he did, believe me. Sorobor knows how to use leverage like this.</Value>
  </Dialogue>

    <Key>Rissa_Purifier_04</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Mathias_Purifier_03</Key>
    <Value>As you wish. As long as justice is delivered to those who would do such harm to the Holy Mission, I suppose that is all that matters.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>

    <Value>I wish Lockwell would see reason. While it may be awkward to have two Chamberlords representing one city, The Holy Mission is an essential part of life in Aurai now. We need proper representation!</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cardinal_Purifier_02</Key>
    <Value>The fact that Immaculates were hiding so close to Monsoon is troubling. They are normally intelligent enough to avoid the Hallowed Marsh entirely.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Cardinal_Purifier_a_02</Key>
    <Value>I think they were trying to find a way to break free from their instinct to attack Elatt.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cardinal_Purifier_03</Key>
    <Value>Were they, now? I can only hope they someday find success, although I do not have much hope. It would benefit us all if they overcame their origins, rather than force us to destroy them.</Value>

    <Value>If you need me to slaughter more of them, just let me know.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cardinal_Purifier_04</Key>
    <Value>I shall, but with a heavy heart. Immaculates may be Scourge Beasts, but they can think and reason. It would benefit us all if they overcame their origins, rather than force us to destroy them.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Elatt_Purifier_01</Key>
    <Value>Well done, [PlayerName]. The zeal with which you pursued justice for our fallen comrades, and with which you protected the Marsh is admirable. You have earned my blessing.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Elatt_Purifier_02</Key>
    <Value>I am satisfied with your results, [PlayerName]. The crisis is over and the perpetrator will be punished. Without a definitive legal judgment, though, such a situation may arise again.</Value>
  </Dialogue>

    <Value>Oh no. They’re coming for me. I wasn’t expecting this so soon... 300 silver! I'll give you 300 silver if you just &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;pretend you didn't see me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; and you just let me go!</Value>

    <Value />
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_BloodSun_03</Key>
    <Value>You also killed Baron Montgomery, I hear. I won’t ask for the details. As far as I’m concerned, the number of corpses in that torture room more than merits his death. I’ll report you killing him as self-defense and leave it at that. Good work.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_BloodSun_05</Key>
    <Value>My men will take Pietro into custody, [PlayerName]. The Heroic Kingdom is in your debt. I will personally report your impact to King Simeon himself, and see to it that he rewards you adequately.</Value>

    <Value>Sorry, I don’t have anything you don’t already know.</Value>

    <Value>Hmm... I appreciate the evidence you have, but &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;there’s not enough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; for me to move on this. I’m doing my own investigation and not everything lines up yet. If you find some more, please report back to me immediately.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_BloodSun_08</Key>
    <Value>This is... I can’t avoid this conclusion any longer. The way this lines up with my own investigation... Prince Pietro, what in Elatt’s name were you thinking?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_BloodSun_09</Key>
    <Value>Based on what we’ve found, it seems like Prince Pietro has been plotting a coup against King Simeon and Queen Calixa, and that he masterminded the attack on Berg as well.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_BloodSun_10</Key>
    <Value>Not to mention he’s been making use of that damned smuggler’s tunnel under the slums that Baron Montgomery got built.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_BloodSun_11</Key>
    <Value>We need to move on the pair of them. I have a squadron of troops ready to go, but &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;I could use the extra help&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. Are you ready to go now?</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_BloodSun_12</Key>
    <Value>&lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;We’re going to flush them out of that smuggler’s tunnel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. You and I will go in from the Baron’s manor, I’ll have Yzan hold down the Palace side entrance, and my troops will cover the slums exit and the desert exit. Come on, let’s roll.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_BloodSun_13</Key>
    <Value>Very well. Yzan and I will handle this on our own, then. Come back if you change your mind, and maybe we’ll still have some way for you to help.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_Cyrene_BloodSun_a_00</Key>

    <Value>Let’s talk about the usual stuff, Cyrene.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_BloodSun_14</Key>
    <Value>Alright, we’ve blocked off the other exits. Let’s split up and take this area cleanly. &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep your eyes peeled for the Prince Pietro, and the Baron&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. We don’t want either of them to risk slipping through our fingers.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Cyrene_BloodSun_15</Key>
    <Value>Gladly. For the record, I’m sorry it turned out this way Pietro. You’re not who I thought you were. As for you, [PlayerName], good work.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>FakePriest_BloodSun_03</Key>
    <Value>Y-yeah- I mean no- I mean... They set me up, alright! They gave me a big sack of coins to run straight down the main street of Levant in this getup. Then I heard "Stop him! He killed Prince Jaden", and I knew I had to get as far away from the city as I could! I’m just a puppet, I swear!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>FakePriest_BloodSun_04</Key>
    <Value>I know I should probably head back to the meetup point, but considering they're willing to murder a prince I'm freaked out that they might kill me just to keep me quiet! I can't stay out here forever, but I'm scared to go back!</Value>

    <Value>&lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;Near the giant insect hives, there’s this old prison in a cave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. I know some bandits sometimes used to use it to stash goods or people they want to get rid of. My contact used that place for us to meet up!</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>FakePriest_BloodSun_08</Key>
    <Value>I don't know, the guys all had masks on and nobody used their real name. I thought this was just a distraction for a robbery or something, I didn't think someone, let alone Prince Jaden would end up dead, I swear!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_FakePriest_BloodSun_b_07</Key>
    <Value>You should probably turn yourself in.</Value>

    <Value>I'm not risking a life sentence in that cell in the slums! Not to mention whoever organized this mess would put me on their short list for a very bloody accident if I ran my mouth! I'm not going back to Levant, no way, no how!</Value>

    <Value>Why would you do this?</Value>

    <Value>My parents have grown soft. Old Levant is an existential threat to us, and still they want to welcome their people to join us! And they still treat the Blue Chamber Collective like equals! We were not elected by simple humans, we were anointed kings and queens by a GOD!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>PrincePietro_BloodSun_05</Key>
    <Value>My brother was too nosy, he would have found out about my plot to kill Calixa and Simeon eventually. And I needed to be secure in the knowledge that I would be the only true heir to Levant's throne. It was nothing personal.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>LevantInn_BloodSun_02</Key>

    <Value>The news just broke, Lysia! No, they haven’t caught the bastard yet! But my money's on that &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;priest of Elatt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; who was seen sprinting out of the palace right about the time the Queen found the body.

    <Key>LevantInn_BloodSun_06</Key>
    <Value>What are you talking about? The Holy Mission robes are white and gold! Anyway, point is, he either has to come back here and face his due justice, or he'll be feeding the vultures with his own flesh the moment he runs out of water.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>OtherInns_BloodSun_02</Key>
    <Value>The Queen found Prince Jaden dead in a chair in his room, strangled from behind by a leather strap. Levant is in a complete uproar over the assassination!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>OtherInns_BloodSun_03</Key>
    <Value>Who killed him? Has anyone claimed responsibility?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>OtherInns_BloodSun_04</Key>
    <Value>No one. But they did see a &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;priest of Elatt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; fleeing the palace and &lt;color=#00CCFF&gt;&lt;b&gt;into the desert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; around the time the prince was killed. That's their prime suspect at this point.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>OtherInns_BloodSun_05</Key>
    <Value>A priest from the Holy Mission? Murdering a prince? That doesn't seem right. The Holy Mission is politically neutral, all they care about is protecting Aurai from the Scourge!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>OtherInns_BloodSun_06</Key>
    <Value>True. This brings to mind two possibilities. Either the real killer wants to frame the Holy Mission, or the Royal Family of Levant is trying to bargain with the Scourge.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>OtherInns_BloodSun_07</Key>
    <Value>Elatt's breath, I can only hope it's the former. Hopefully the truth will come out when they find that fleeing priest.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>OtherInns_BloodSun_08</Key>
    <Value>I doubt they'll find him. Abrassar desert is huge, and no matter how much Elatt favors you, if you don't find water out there within a few days, you're going to drop dead.</Value>

    <Value>You there! You look like a capable explorer! Might I hire you for something? I’ve heard of a blood-red Idol hidden in this place. I’ll pay you 300 silver if you bring it to me!</Value>
  </Dialogue>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Enmerkar_SQ_RedScholar_02</Key>
    <Value>It does? Wonderful! That means it really is the genuine article! I know a woman who’ll pay really well for an artifact like this! Here, your cut. Nice working with you, stranger!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Enmerkar_SQ_RedScholar_03</Key>
    <Value>Be careful down there. The place is crawling with Burning Men, and I’m positive I saw Wendigo tracks a little further in…</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Enmerkar_SQ_RedScholar_04</Key>
    <Value>Are you sure? Huh. I think I’ll go check for it myself. If you “scoured” the place like you claim, there shouldn’t be too many dangerous beasts left in here. Alright, thanks for your help. I’ll take it from here. Farewell, stranger!</Value>

    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_09</Key>
    <Value>I have an offer for you. I wish to test you. Should I learn from you during this test, I will offer you ancient knowledge, lost to the mists of time. If you are brave enough to enter my crucible, I welcome you.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_22</Key>
    <Value>The one handed axe, the weapon of warriors. I will require one piece of hackmanite, a palladium scrap and a tsar stone.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_23</Key>
    <Value>The greataxe, weapon of barbarians. I will require one piece of hackmanite, a palladium scrap and two tsar stones.</Value>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_25</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_30</Key>
    <Value>The greatsword, weapon of the reckless and brave. I will require one piece of hackmanite, a palladium scrap and two tsar stones.</Value>

    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_a_31</Key>
    <Value>Your machines are full of Corruption! What are you doing in here?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_32</Key>
    <Value>Notice how the Corruption in the pipes flows towards me. I pump the Corruption of the marsh towards myself and I consume it. When properly channelled, it can be a source of life, twisted though it may be.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_33</Key>
    <Value>This is why I call myself the Plague Doctor. I take the world’s Corruption, toxic to your kind, and I filter, cleanse, and consume it. In this way, everyone wins.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_34</Key>
    <Value>And trust me, after that explosion of Corruption that created these nasty "Scourge" creatures, Aurai can't be picky about who does the cleaning up!</Value>

    <Value>How did you become a Lich?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_35</Key>
    <Value>How were you born? I do not remember the moment of my rebirth. It's actually rather impertinent to think you can ask such a personal question.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_c_31</Key>
    <Value>If you feed on Corruption, how did you get by before the Scourge?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_36</Key>
    <Value>The Corruption has always been here. It is a natural part of the world. I've never had a lack of Corruption to consume. In fact, the Scourge has made things harder for me. Now there's far too much Corruption for me to deal with.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_TsarDarkLich_37</Key>
    <Value>I trust that Elatt will beat the Scourge back with time, but in all honesty, he could use some help. More help than a few enhanced humans can provide at any rate.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_01</Key>
    <Value>Not one step further, bearer of Corruption! Turn back or your life is forfeit! The Light Mender will not tolerate your presence here!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_02</Key>
    <Value>I am the Light Mender. I am not someone to be trifled with. I have seen centuries pass in my time as a lich, and I will not let you sully this place with the Corruption in your very blood.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_b_01</Key>
    <Value>I’ll go wherever I damn well please, voice!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_03</Key>
    <Value>Not if you value your life. Turn back now, or I shall blast your bone to ash and purify you with thunder and light!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_a_03</Key>
    <Value>Corruption? I’m just your average human explorer, what are you talking about?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_b_03</Key>
    <Value>I’m with the Holy Mission, Elatt’s light is within me. How could I possibly bear Corruption?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_c_03</Key>
    <Value>You’re clearly not a good person. I’ll teach you a lesson, Light Mender!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_04</Key>
    <Value>Every human on this wretched world is a catalyst for the Corruption. So long as even one of your kind breathes, there can be no hope for preserving the world. The only way is to cleanse it with light and thunder!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_05</Key>
    <Value>You’re one of Elatt’s minions? Don’t make me laugh. I know the circumstances of his creation. To think his existence can be a balm against the Corruption is foolish in the extreme. He lacks the means and the heart to do what needs to be done.</Value>
  </Dialogue>

    <Value />
  </Dialogue>

    <Value>So you’re planning to destroy humanity, is that it?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_b_05</Key>
    <Value>Corruption is a natural part of the world, though, isn’t it?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_09</Key>
    <Value>Have you been speaking to that damn Plague Doctor? He is a slave to it! He would cover the world in Corruption so he might feast endlessly! Trust his words at the world’s peril!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_10</Key>
    <Value>I would rather transform your species into something better, and will dedicate many more centuries to this plan. But if I have to choose between humanity and the existence of the world, I will choose the world. I don’t expect you to understand.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_11</Key>
    <Value>Leave. Now. You have nothing to fear from me if you depart, my plans will take centuries more to bring to fruition. But if you interfere with me, I will show you no mercy.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_a_11</Key>
    <Value>I know when I’m not wanted. I’ll leave.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_b_11</Key>
    <Value>Leave? And let you continue planning the destruction of my kind? I don’t think so.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_14</Key>
    <Value>You would fight me? Human foolishness is proven yet again! Raise your fist against me and you will be scoured clean of Corruption where you stand!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_15</Key>
    <Value>Enough! I will fight no more! You are an exceptional warrior, human. My injuries will take weeks to repair.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_16</Key>
    <Value>But know this, though you have delayed my work, you have not stopped me. I am an immortal lich. The phylactery that maintains my immortality is hidden safely from humankind. You can not slay me, no matter how hard you try!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_17</Key>
    <Value>Go on, then. Leave with your precious little victory! When my injuries have been repaired, my work will resume once again!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_a_17</Key>
    <Value>Then I’ll just come back in a few days and beat you down again.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_b_17</Key>
    <Value>So you’re saying I just have to come back in a few days to stop you again? Ok, sure.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_c_17</Key>
    <Value>Same time next week, then? We can do this for years, you know.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_18</Key>
    <Value>What? You’d... come back again and again just to keep me beaten down?! You monstrous, inhuman beast! Is your thirst for violence endless?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_a_18</Key>
    <Value>I beat you once, I can do it again. Or you can just stop what you’re doing and make this all go away.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_b_18</Key>
    <Value>I don’t want to, but if you’re going to keep planning to mess with my people, so help me I will!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_c_18</Key>
    <Value>Who’s the monstrous one, again? I’m going to enjoy breaking you over and over!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_19</Key>
    <Value>An endless circle of violence? This benefits neither of us. I have a counter-proposal, human. I will cease my work until your life has ended. If that is not enough, I have material wealth I can provide to buy your peace.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_20</Key>
    <Value>This spire is a vast collection tool for rare resources. Return every week, and I will share some of the minerals and rare ores it provides me, and I can prove to you that my work has ceased. In this way, no more violence is needed.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_a_20</Key>
    <Value>Alright. But if I catch even one whiff that you’re working to harm humanity...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_b_20</Key>
    <Value>Deal. You’d better keep your end of the bargain, lich!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_c_20</Key>
    <Value>Ah, now we’re talking. I’m glad we could come to a reasonable arrangement.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_21</Key>
    <Value>You can trust my word. A delay of a few decades means nothing to one who is immortal. I may not be pleased with this turn of events, but I have more to lose if I break my word to you. I am glad we could find a more efficient use of our time.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_22</Key>
    <Value>Here, as a show of good faith, you may have your first peace payment. You may choose to take three of these rare materials with you. Then leave me be!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_23</Key>
    <Value>You are here for your next payment, human?</Value>

    <Value>Here, you may choose three of these rare materials. Then leave me in peace!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_25</Key>
    <Value>You ask for the impossible. Even with all the power in this spire, it would take centuries to create even a single one, and to collect one would be nearly as hard. No, you will have to be satisfied with what I offer.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>

    <Value />

    <Value>So, what do you do with your time now?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_28</Key>
    <Value>I have returned to my old studies on mechanical creations. If I cannot continue with my intended plans, I can at least continue to perfect my means of opposing the Scourge.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_29</Key>
    <Value>If one of your servants takes a swipe at me, I’m going to break it. You realize that, right?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_30</Key>
    <Value>They are designed to be broken. How else could I test their effectiveness in combat?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_31</Key>
    <Value>Approach the sphere of your choice, and I shall tell you what it contains, and offer you the bounty within. You may choose three times before the spire’s power is spent.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_32</Key>
    <Value>It's not time for the next payment, human. Return once a week has passed. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_33</Key>
    <Value>Ammolite is a wise choice. It is difficult to find, even for me. My spire can collect one chunk of it for you, if you desire it.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_34</Key>
    <Value>Blue Sand? Humankind tells so many strange stories about the origin of this material. Even I don’t know the truth. The spire can collect two handfuls worth of this for you.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HallowedMarsh_SQ_LightMenderLich_35</Key>
    <Value>Copal, such a curious mineral. I teased the secrets from this material long ago. The spire can generate two chunks of it for you.</Value>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Salaberry_Postgame_02</Key>
    <Value>We’re keeping the success of the Pacification project under wraps for now, until Turnbull finishes the large scale application of the runes. But not long from now, it will be time to make this dream a reality.</Value>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Salaberry_Postgame_03</Key>

    <Key>Desy_Postgame_01</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Desy_Postgame_02</Key>
    <Value>Well, my intentions haven’t changed. I’ll find other ways to support my friends and family in their fight against the Scourge. Harmattan is a place full of opportunity.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Desy_Postgame_03</Key>
    <Value>Our friend visits nearby from time to time. Would you believe we share a similar taste in books, [PlayerName]? What a time to be alive...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Victor_Postgame_01</Key>
    <Value>Looks like the region is safe from the looming threat of the Scourge that Turnbull nearly unleashed upon us. Can you imagine the danger that unchained Immaculates would have presented? </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Victor_Postgame_02</Key>
    <Value>I hope you’ve learned from your mistake, [PlayerName]. I know what’s best for Harmattan, for the region, even for you. Can you say you’re happier now, more than you were working for me?</Value>

    <Value>Yes, actually.</Value>

    <Key>Victor_Postgame_03</Key>
    <Value>Tsk, then you’re still an imbecile. Someday you’ll realize what a fool you were, and that you should never have gotten it into your head to leave my service. But by then, it’ll be too late.</Value>

    <Key>Player_Victor_Postgame_02_b</Key>
    <Value>Not really.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Victor_Postgame_04</Key>
    <Value>Such a shame you did not realize it sooner. Because now it’s too late. After all this, you’re not even worth taking on as an apprentice.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Victor_Postgame_06</Key>
    <Value>Well, I hope you’re happy with yourself. My tracker Golem project has to undergo massive revision, my reputation has taken a hit, and Artois is missing and presumed dead.</Value>

    <Key>Player_Victor_Postgame_06_a</Key>
    <Value>Someday you’ll appreciate all we did.</Value>

    <Key>Player_Victor_Postgame_06_b</Key>
    <Value>Still upset that you lost? You can accept you were wrong without being this way.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Victor_Postgame_08</Key>
    <Value>It’s not about right or wrong. It’s about my well deserved victory being stolen from me. Months of work, sent back to the drawing board. I have every right to be upset at you. Now, shoo!</Value>

  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Naturalist_Postgame_01</Key>

    <Key>History_Postgame_01</Key>

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>History_Postgame_02</Key>
    <Value>Well, history doesn’t lie. The Scourge have been nothing but monstrous by nature all this time. Perhaps it’s for the best not to divert the course of history quite so much all at once.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Engineer_Postgame_01</Key>
    <Value>Elatt’s breath, this is an exciting time to be alive! Pacified Scourge! Immaculates who may want to buy our technology! This shakes things up so much I have no idea where to even start!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Engineer_Postgame_02</Key>
    <Value>I’m hard at work on our newest project. Now that those new Golems are entering more wide-scale production, I’ve shunted that onto my Scholars. Let the little people handle the repetitive grunt work!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Mercantile_Postgame_01</Key>
    <Value>I’m quite happy that Victor’s been taken down a peg or two. I know that he has been eyeing my position for years. After that debate, I’m more certain than ever he can’t be trusted with it.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Mercantile_Postgame_02</Key>
    <Value>It’s a terrible shame that Turnbull’s project was put on hold. Having an entire species owe us the greatest favor of all time, and being open to trade, would have brought in an incredible amount of wealth to the Academy.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Academic_Postgame_01</Key>
    <Value>That was too much excitement over the past few months. Immaculates, attempted sabotage… This is all quite terrible for the academic reputation of the Academy.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Academic_Postgame_02</Key>
    <Value>We should be seen as a place of higher learning, not some...Mad scientist’s lab filled with infighting!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Arcane_Postgame_01</Key>
    <Value>I’m on the verge of not just losing my Dean status, but of being outright exiled. Well...Such is life. I won’t hold it against you, but I can’t afford to support you any further. Good luck out there, [PlayerName]. Good luck to us all.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Arcane_Postgame_02</Key>
    <Value>It is a terrible shame that the Immaculate Project was put on hold...But I have hope that someday, we’ll be able to finish the job. Our deal is still good, don’t you worry [PlayerName]. You’re always welcome here at the Arcane branch of Sorobor.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Arcane_Postgame_03</Key>
    <Value>This success goes beyond my wildest dreams. This is a moment that will go down in the history books. My own legacy is all but secured for generations to come.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Arcane_Postgame_04</Key>
    <Value>The headmaster has insisted we take our time ironing out the details of how we’ll mass-deploy the Pacification spell, but we’re making good progress. It won’t be long before we can start spreading it far and wide.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Arcane_Postgame_05</Key>
    <Value>It will be years before the full effects are felt, and several more before we finally see what a truly pacified Scourge horde will look like...But damn, if this doesn’t still feel like total victory.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Arcane_Postgame_06</Key>
    <Value>I couldn’t have done it without you, [PlayerName]. Thank you for all of your support. Even if your name never makes it into the books, rest assured that you’ve had an impact on Harmattan’s history.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>RunedImmaculate_Postgame_01</Key>
    <Value>Ah. It is good to see you again. I look at these teachings of the Cabal of Winds, and I see structure there. Something that my Kin may need going forward.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_RunedImmaculate_Postgame_01_a</Key>
    <Value>Wait, so you’ll start following the Cabal of Wind’s religion?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>RunedImmaculate_Postgame_02</Key>
    <Value>Perhaps, perhaps not. I merely look for structure to help guide my kind to a way of life that is compatible with humanity. We will see what form that takes.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_RunedImmaculate_Postgame_01_b</Key>
    <Value>You know, it’s strange that I can’t call you by any kind of name.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>RunedImmaculate_Postgame_03</Key>
    <Value>I begin to think...Immaculates have never needed names before. But if we are to deal with humanity more frequently, we may need to adopt this silly custom of yours. Time will tell.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_RunedImmaculate_Postgame_01_c</Key>
    <Value>How does it feel, being free?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>RunedImmaculate_Postgame_04</Key>
    <Value>Like a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders. But in it’s place, I feel a greater sense of responsibility. If I am free, then I must bear the consequences of my decisions without complaint. It is a trade I feel was worth it.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>RunedImmaculate_Postgame_05</Key>
    <Value>Take care of yourself, friend [PlayerName]. The world is not safe, even with a friend among the Scourge. May our paths cross again.</Value>

    <Key>LowInn_NPC_01</Key>
    <Value>The Blue Chamber Collective doesn’t really believe in the death penalty. The maximum sentence is usually exile, with the understanding that returning will be met with lethal force. That’s not so, here in Harmattan.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>LowInn_NPC_02</Key>
    <Value>It wasn’t the case even back in the old days. The ancient council of nobles felt exile didn’t send a strong enough message. So, the death penalty for high crimes have stayed a tradition here even after the Scourge, regardless of effectiveness.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HighInn_NPC_01</Key>

  <Dialogue>

    <Key>GepFan_NPC_03</Key>
    <Value>You do?! Let me see...You too! I...I have only more questions. Who is he?! I...I just want to repay him for saving my life, and yet no matter who I ask, no one has actually seen the man! It’s infuriating!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_GepFan_NPC_03_a</Key>
    <Value>Maybe he doesn’t actually want thanks and is just that kindhearted.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>GepFan_NPC_04</Key>
    <Value>Probably...But it just makes me want to meet him even more now. At the very least, I owe him a drink. Whatever he wants, whether it’s tea, or wine or just a bowl of Pearlbird soup. The man’s my personal hero.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_GepFan_NPC_03_b</Key>
    <Value>Maybe he’s a ghost or a wandering spirit...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>GepFan_NPC_05</Key>
    <Value>I...I don’t think so. Ghosts would have trouble carrying us to safety for such distances, let alone lighting a fire...Then again, maybe I just don’t want this to be true because I don’t want to imagine him wandering, trapped in his memories as an undead ghost...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>Player_GepFan_NPC_03_c</Key>
    <Value>...Hmm...Why not pay it forward? Why not do like Gep, yourself?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>GepFan_NPC_06</Key>
    <Value>I hadn’t considered that. Does this strange legend exist to urge us all to help one another, and ask for no thanks in return? But then...Who started it? Who was the original Gep who extended a helping hand? ...I want to meet him even more now...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>GepFan_NPC_07</Key>
    <Value>*Sigh* I don’t know if I’ll ever find the truth. But I’ll drink to him all the same. There need to be more Geps in the world.</Value>

    <Key>LeyLine_Hamattan_01</Key>
    <Value>Ah, yes. I can teach you the power of the Scorching Touch. Enemies touched by this hex will find themselves further vulnerable to the power of your flames. Pay me 50 silver and it’s yours.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>LeyLine_Hamattan_02</Key>
    <Value>Excellent. It’s quite simple. Picture a roaring fire, and concentrate your mana into the palm of your hand until you feel like it’s stinging in pain. One strong strike will pass that on into your foe’s entire nervous system. See? Simple.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>DoomTrainer_01</Key>
    <Value>I have a little something I can teach you. The Doom Hex primes your foe to take considerably more damage from lightning. I’m feeling charitable, how does 50 silver sound?</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>DoomTrainer_02</Key>
    <Value>Good. Now, pay attention...Use your magic to generate a little ball of static between your thumb and ring finger and then-</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>DoomTrainer_03</Key>
    <Value>-There, just like that! The effect of that static will make them quite vulnerable to additional shocks!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HauntTrainer_01</Key>
    <Value>Yes, I could teach you the Haunt hex. I use a summoned ghost to protect me when I need to venture outside, and this hex makes my foes even more vulnerable to his ethereal attacks! I’ll teach you for 50 silver!</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HauntTrainer_02</Key>
    <Value>Deal! So, what you do is focus your Mana, and “puncture” the outside of your foe’s soul, causing it to leak a little bit, then-</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>HauntTrainer_03</Key>
    <Value>-There! Exactly right! It's also helpful when using conjured runic weapons and traps too!</Value>

    <Key>Guard_NorthExit_blocked</Key>
    <Value>The North exits are closed for the moment, visitor. Repairs are being done to Old Harmattan’s walls, and we can’t risk any ghosts slipping into the city proper!</Value>

    <Key>MilitaryDistrictNote_01</Key>
    <Value>Even with the Vigil directly on top of the great Scourge tunnel, and even with the thing entirely flooded, I suspect the Scourge are still using splinter tunnels to get around the region. We need a better way to track the beasts...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>LibraryNote_01</Key>
    <Value>My studies of the Vigil Crystal...They lead me to believe that the Scourge have an innate connection to the realm of dreams...Sleeping near a Vigil often leads to horrendous nightmares...I suspect the same may be the case for sleeping Scourge...</Value>

    <Key>WendigoBooks_01</Key>
    <Value>3rd Late Autumn: The Scourge are beating down the flimsy barricades. The Golems are barely able to hold them off. There is little food, and no rescue in sight, though Upper Harmattan is just a few strides away.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>WendigoBooks_02</Key>
    <Value>I know the legend. That to partake of human flesh will bring down the wrath of all life. But my choices are starve, or take my chances that the legend is just that. A legend. The choice is obvious.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>WendigoBooks_03</Key>
    <Value>2nd midwinter: Rescue still not coming. Scourge are still roaming at our barricades. Timothy gave me odd looks at our turn on watch. He said it was freezing cold, and asked why I was not bundled in furs. </Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>WendigoBooks_04</Key>
    <Value>I told him that I was not cold at all, and Jenna needed my furs more. In fact...I have not felt cold at all this winter...I worry that Timothy suspects...</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>WendigoBooks_05</Key>
    <Value>12th Midwinter: The legend is a sham. While everyone rations the last few rotten bread loaves and salted meat, or chokes on poisonous scourge flesh in desperation, I am full and strong, feeding just on the fallen alone.</Value>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue>
    <Key>WendigoBooks_06</Key>
    <Value>In fact, I have never felt stronger. Never more keen and alert. Even if Timothy suspects me...What can anyone do? They are frail, starved, weak. I am strong. I am predator, they are-</Value>

    <Key>WendigoBooks_07</Key>
    <Value>18th Midwinter: The beast is coming. I can hear it coming for me. It's clawing through the walls, it's screaming for my blood, it will devour me, I cannot get out I cannot get away I cannot stop it kill it killitkillit-</Value>
